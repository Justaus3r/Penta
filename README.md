_A cmd/command prompt/shell/command interpreter(whatever you say) purely written in python_ .tries to be more efficient ,functional and easier to use than our classic cmd.
Here is a table of commands that Penta supports as of now.i also converted a part of project into Python2(as an experiment),if you want to check that out just see the ```Pent2.py```. 
Note: Please note that commands that have additional argumnents such as ```cd <directory>``` are index sensitive.i.e ```cd MyDirectory``` and ```cd  MyDirectory```(with extra space) are interpreted differently.

#### Upcoming update
--?
### Windows installation
**Penta will only run on windows 10.**

Download the setup from link above and execute it.after installing the setup,be sure to add the directory (present in installation Directory) named **bin** to [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
### Linux installation:
**if you are using bash instead of zsh,then edit Setup.sh and replace ```.zshrc``` with ```.bashrc```** 
Download the zip file from link above and follow following steps
- Unzip and file and cd to the directory.
- Open terminal here and type ```chmod +x Setup.sh ``` to give executable permission to script.
- Run the script i.e ./Setup.sh
- Restart the terminal after installing the setup
- Type ```penta``` and Have Fun ðŸ¥³...
#### Manual Installation(if the script doesn't work):
- Unzip the file and copy\move the ```bin``` ,```configs``` folder and executable named Penta to home directory
- Give executable permission to Penta.sh and copy\move it to /bin folder(linux bin folder and be sure that its on $PATH)
- (Optional)Now edit your ```.bashrc``` file and add a alias at the end of it: ```alias penta=Penta.sh```

**NOTE** Please be sure that your /bin directory is on $PATH. 

### Uninstallation:
Uninstallation in windows is pretty straightforward ,you just uninstall it like other softwares but there is no uninstalller for linux.delete Penta.sh from /bin folder,edit ```.bashrc``` file and remove the alias if any. and also remove the folder named ```bin```,```configs``` and Penta from home directory.
## Build from source
### Windows/Linux:
Penta can be built from pyinstaller,py2exe and Nuitka.
[Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/command-window_656) used in Building Penta.

**[Nuitka(Recommended)](https://nuitka.net/)**([User manual](https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html)):
- First install nuitka using ```pip install Nuitka```.
- Now open cmd in same Folder as the Project Folder and Type ```python3 -m nuitka --plugin-enable=tk-inter --windows-icon-from-ico=IconFileIfAnyIfNotThenSkipThisFlag --standalone Penta.py```(for linux remove the windows related flags)
- For the First time it's going to take some time depending on your network speed as nuitka installs a gcc compiler,for all the messages press Y.
- Your Executable will be compiled in Penta.dist.All the files in the dist folder are necessary to run Penta.if you want to make a single file executable then you can use the --onefile flag but i wouldn't recommend it. 

**[Py2exe](https://www.py2exe.org/)**:
- First install py2exe using ```pip install py2exe```.
- Now Create a file named setup.py or whatever.
- if you want to add icon *then*:
```
from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe
setup_dict = dict(console=[{'script':'Penta.py','icon_resources':[(0,'ICON.ico')]}])
setup(**setup_dict)
```
- Otherwise there is no need to create a dictionary i.e:
```
from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe
setup(console=['Penta.py'])
```
-now use python setup.py py2exe to build it.

**[Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**
- install pyinstaller using ```pip install pyinstaller```
- Now just cd to Project Folder and use ```pyinstaller --icon IconFileIfAny --onefile Penta.py```
- Your project will be built under the dist directory.

# ðŸ”´ Note: ðŸ”´
Please do not confuse with the word "pure python" as some core operations such as shutting down pc ,etc require interaction with OS API(or thats what i think after my research),and low level languages are used to do so.python is a high level language and i think it can't interact with Os like C and other ll languages do.so i have used system commands to do such things.**if you think i am wrong**,Please do correct me ðŸ™‚..
