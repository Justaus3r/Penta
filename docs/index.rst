*A cmd/command prompt/shell/command interpreter(whatever you say) purely written in python* .tries to be more efficient ,functional and easier to use than our classic cmd.
Here is a table of commands that Penta supports as of now.i also converted a part of project into Python2(as an experiment),if you want to check that out just see the ``Pent2.py``. 

Note:
~~~~~

**Please note that commands that have additional argumnents such as ``cd <directory>`` are index sensitive.i.e ``cd MyDirectory`` and ``cd  MyDirectory``\ (with extra space) are interpreted differently.also all the system commands are also supported**

Windows installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Penta will only run on windows 10.**

Download the setup from link above and execute it.after installing the setup,be sure to add the directory (present in installation Directory) named **bin** to `PATH <https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/>`_.

Linux installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**if you are using bash instead of zsh,then edit Setup.sh and replace ``.zshrc`` with ``.bashrc``\ ** 
Download the zip file from link above and follow following steps


* Unzip and file and cd to the directory.
* Open terminal here and type ``chmod +x Setup.sh`` to give executable permission to script.
* Run the script i.e ./Setup.sh
* Restart the terminal after installing the setup
* Type ``penta`` and Have Fun ðŸ¥³...
  #### Manual Installation(if the script doesn't work):
* Unzip the file and copy\move the ``bin`` ,\ ``configs`` folder and executable named Penta to home directory
* Give executable permission to Penta.sh and copy\move it to /bin folder(linux bin folder and be sure that its on $PATH)
* (Optional)Now edit your ``.bashrc`` file and add a alias at the end of it: ``alias penta=Penta.sh``

**NOTE** Please be sure that your /bin directory is on $PATH. 

Uninstallation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uninstallation in windows is pretty straightforward ,you just uninstall it like other softwares but there is no uninstalller for linux.delete Penta.sh from /bin folder,edit ``.bashrc`` file and remove the alias if any. and also remove the folder named ``bin``\ ,\ ``configs`` and Penta from home directory.

Build from source
-----------------

Windows/Linux:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Penta can be built from pyinstaller,py2exe and Nuitka.
`Icon <https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/command-window_656>`_ used in Building Penta.

**\ `Nuitka(Recommended) <https://nuitka.net/>`_\ **\ (\ `User manual <https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html>`_\ ):


* First install nuitka using ``pip install Nuitka``.
* Now open cmd in same Folder as the Project Folder and Type ``python3 -m nuitka --plugin-enable=tk-inter --windows-icon-from-ico=IconFileIfAnyIfNotThenSkipThisFlag --standalone Penta.py``\ (for linux remove the windows related flags)
* For the First time it's going to take some time depending on your network speed as nuitka installs a gcc compiler,for all the messages press Y.
* Your Executable will be compiled in Penta.dist.All the files in the dist folder are necessary to run Penta.if you want to make a single file executable then you can use the --onefile flag but i wouldn't recommend it. 

**\ `Py2exe <https://www.py2exe.org/>`_\ **\ :


* First install py2exe using ``pip install py2exe``.
* Now Create a file named setup.py or whatever.
* if you want to add icon *then*\ :
  .. code-block::

     from distutils.core import setup
     import py2exe
     setup_dict = dict(console=[{'script':'Penta.py','icon_resources':[(0,'ICON.ico')]}])
     setup(**setup_dict)

* Otherwise there is no need to create a dictionary i.e:
  .. code-block::

     from distutils.core import setup
     import py2exe
     setup(console=['Penta.py'])
  -now use python setup.py py2exe to build it.

**\ `Pyinstaller <https://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_\ **


* install pyinstaller using ``pip install pyinstaller``
* Now just cd to Project Folder and use ``pyinstaller --icon IconFileIfAny --onefile Penta.py``
* Your project will be built under the dist directory.
